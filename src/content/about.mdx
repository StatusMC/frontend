You maybe know other same services for pinging Minecraft servers, like https://mcstatus.io or https://mcsrvstat.us.
And you may ask, why do we need another one? Well, the answer is not so simple. Firstly, I wanted to write this project
to resolve [this feature request](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus/issues/157) and add another project to my portfolio.
But the idea of building same service as there are wasn't accepted. Anyway, I started to build this project by myself,
and during the development, I found the feature to add, that it will not look like just the same service.

This feature is modules system. In other services, you can only get the server status (java or bedrock), but here you can
get Java status, Bedrock status and Query answer in _one_ request! These three request are done in parallel on the backend
(aka our API), so you don't need to even know how does asynchronous programming work or what are threads. You can also
set different IPs for each module, so you can get Java status from one server and Bedrock status from another one.

Also, each answer is hardly typed with [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev)'s models, so you can always look at sources
if I will forget to update these docs. This also ensures stability of the API, because if there will be any mistake in
types - there will be an error on our side, not yours! (We track those with [Sentry](https://sentry.io), so don't worry,
we have a guy who will spam our email if something will go wrong).
