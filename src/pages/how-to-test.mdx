Hi! I'm glad that you proposed your help for me!

This is almost complete version of frontend for StatusMC project (more info [here](/about)).
I'm not a frontend developer, so I need your help to test it and fix bugs.

There is no API or backend for now, but there are placeholder objects! You can input any IP into
the search bar, and it will give you an answer with random data. Look at it, find bugs and report
them to the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/StatusMC/frontend/issues)!

If you will write `offline` instead of IP, the site will show you an example of offline server.

## Known bugs

- There is no README at the [repository](https://github.com/StatusMC/frontend).
- Bad naming (including the project name), contact me if you know how to name everything better.
- There is no API or backend, so you can't get the real data.

For any other issue, please open the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/StatusMC/frontend/issues)!
This includes grammar mistakes too!
