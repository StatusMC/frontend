Hi! I'm glad that you proposed your help for me!

This is almost complete version of frontend for StatusMC project (more info [here](/about)).
I'm not a frontend developer, so I need your help to test it and fix bugs.

There are placeholder objects if you don't know what to input. Input `test` instead of IP to get
an example of online server, and `offline` for offline server.
Look at it, find bugs and report them to the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/StatusMC/frontend/issues)!

## Known bugs

- There is no README at the [repository](https://github.com/StatusMC/frontend).
- Bad naming (including the project name), contact me if you know how to name everything better.
- ~~There is no API or backend, so you can't get the real data.~~ Finally added and connected backend!

For any other issue, please open the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/StatusMC/frontend/issues)!
This includes grammar mistakes too!
