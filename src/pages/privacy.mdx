This page was written by human to simply describe how we use your data.

---

We don't collect any of your personal data except for some cases (continue reading). We collect analytics (number of visitors, most used browser, [etc](https://docs.simpleanalytics.com/what-we-collect)) via [simpleanalytics.com](http://simpleanalytics.com).

Although, on case of any error occures on frontend, we collect a lot of your personal info via [sentry.io](http://sentry.io) to reproduce the bug. We do not use that data for anything else.

Also, we save every response and other info from every Minecraft server for later analysis and improvement of our underlying library - [mcstatus](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus).

All our code is [open-source](https://github.com/StatusMC), so you can verify every word here!
