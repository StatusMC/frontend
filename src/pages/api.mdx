We have a very simple but powerful API. All answers are returned as JSON, so it's language inclusive. The main goal of
API is to provide as much as possible data in a single request, without making it long. All fetched requests are cached
for 5 minutes at our CDN (CloudFlare) and local database.

Please, feel free to contact us at <code>{CONFIG.contactEmail}</code> if you will find any errors, unclear information
or if you will need any help with our service.

## Cache

We have implemented a caching system for all data that we retrieve from our service, including server status responses
and icons, to reduce spam and deliberate denial-of-service attacks. Each endpoint has its own unique cache duration,
specific to the request pathname. Any requests made after cache expiration time will result in fresh data being
retrieved from our end. We do not make any exceptions to the cache duration. If you want to bypass the cache, we
recommend that you self-host the backend server available on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MCStatusWeb/backend)
or use the original library - [mcstatus](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus) (Python).

## Supported Versions

Our API supports all modern Minecraft servers, including Bedrock and Education Edition servers. Please
ensure that you use the correct endpoint when retrieving server status. Attempting to use the Java Edition status route
with a Bedrock Edition host (or vice versa) will result in a response indicating that the server is offline unless the
server explicitly supports cross-play. If the server you are specifying does not use the standard port value (`25565`
for Java Edition, `19132` for Bedrock Edition), you will need to specify the port using the following format:
`host:port`.

Please inform us at <code>{CONFIG.contactEmail}</code> if you will find unsupported server.

## Using the API

If an address works in Minecraft, it works with our API. If you do not specify a port, our API will find it. SRV records
are also supported.

### Java Status

Retrieves all possible information from a Java Edition server. Currently, this includes only status data (that shown at
server list in Minecraft client) and some IP info. {/* TODO add query */}

<Endpoint url="v1/status/java/{ip}" model="java" />

### Bedrock Status

All the same what with Java, but there are some additional attributes that are special for Bedrock.

<Endpoint url="v1/status/bedrock/{ip}" model="bedrock" />

### Offline Status

If the server is offline, we still can get some useful info from it.

<Endpoint model="offline" />
