As you may know from the [About us](/about) page, we have the modules system, which allows to do multiple things with
one request. This works with Query parameters (text after `?` in the URL). For example, if you want to get the server
Java and Bedrock status in one time, you can just send HTTP GET request to `https://api.statusmc.perchun.it/myserver.net?modules=java,bedrock`.

Our API server will send a Java status request to `myserver.net:25565` and Bedrock status request to `myserver.net:19132`.
(Those ports are guessed automatically: if no port specified, we will try `19132` for Bedrock and `25565` (or SRV record)
for Java. You can specify the port adding `:port` to the end of the hostname, for example `myserver.net:12345`).

But what about Java status and Query? Those cannot be hosted on one port, so you need to use another one (e.g. `25566`).
In the modules system, we can specify completely different IP for every module. For example, if you want to get Java
status from `myserver.net:25565` and Query from `myserver.net:25566`, you can send HTTP GET request to
`https://api.statusmc.perchun.it/v1/i_am_ignored?modules=java,query&to_java=myserver.net:25565&to_query=myserver.net:25566`.
(For example, if you will not specify `&to_java=`, the API will use IP from the URL as fallback (in upper example, it's
`i_am_ignored`).)

It's not limited to only ports, but also to completely different IPs:
`https://api.statusmc.perchun.it/v1/hypixel.net?modules=java,bedrock&to_bedrock=mco.cubecraft.net`. This works with Query too!

## Few answers in one? How?

This is the simplest part. Each module provides property in answer, that is named as module. For example, if you will
ask for Java status, the answer will be a JSON object with `java` property where the answer is stored.
In this property, there will be Java status answer object, there is a description of it in the end of the page.

```json
{ "java": {...} }
```

So if you will request all possible modules (`java`, `bedrock`, `query`) - there will be three properties with three
different answers:

```json
{
  "java": {...},
  "bedrock": {...},
  "query": {...}
}
```

<ModelDocumentation model="java" />
<ModelDocumentation model="bedrock" />
<ModelDocumentation model="query" />

## What if the server offline?

We just replace it with other object, that has `online` property set to `false`.

<ModelDocumentation model="offline" />

## Icon endpoint

You can get the icon of the server separately, on the `v1/icon/{ip}` endpoint. It will return the icon in PNG format.
This is actually the same as doing Java status request, and decode from Base64 `icon` property. If you need an icon and
Java status, you should do only Java status request and decode the icon from it. This will reduce the network latency
(time between the moment when you sent the request and our server answered on it). The endpoint is actually doing the same.
Also, if you will do two requests (for Java status and icon) - don't worry, we cache the Java status answer, so
we don't spam the server!

The endpoint is `https://api.statusmc.perchun.it/v1/icon/myserver.net`. Replace the `myserver.net` part with your IP.
This is not done as one of modules, because the endpoint return bytes that cannot be properly encoded into JSON, and
even if so, there is no sense to encode those, as you can just use `icon` property from Java status answer with the
same impact.

## Supported Versions

Our API supports all modern Minecraft servers, including Bedrock and Education Edition servers. Please
ensure that you use the correct module when retrieving server status. Attempting to use the Java Edition status module
with a Bedrock Edition host (or vice versa) will result in a response indicating that the answer doesn't have
the property with data, that you expected.

Please inform us at <code>{CONFIG.contactEmail}</code> if you will find unsupported server.

## Cache

We have a cache system on our CDN (Cloudflare) which uses an URL as a key and another cache system on our backend,
that caches each module individually. Second one is quite slower, but more efficient. Anyway, you're free to spam
as many requests, as you want. But note that our service is a proxy and helping tool for other humans, do not use
it for example server scanners, or similar software where performance is important. You can self-host our backend
server (see [GitHub repository](https://github.com/StatusMC/backend)) or use the original library -
[mcstatus](https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus) (Python).
